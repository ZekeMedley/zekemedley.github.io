    <p>
        Frankly, I’m no expert on making a website accessible. Rather than trying to say something worthwhile about something I know little about I’ll link to some articles that seem credible and then explain how I used their advice in making this website.

            In addition to reading those articles I also did Apple’s Voice Over tutorial and tried to browse through my own website with it.

        <ul>
        <li>
            Add a <code>lang</code> attribute to your <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tag. For example: <code>&lt;html   lang="en"&gt;</code> for an English website. This ensures that a screen reader will read a website with the correct accent.
        </li>
        <li>
            Make the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> attribute descriptive. This is the first thing that Voice Over will read when you visit a page. I imagine that other screen readers are similar.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use tags like <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> to separate sections of your webpages.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use empty alt text on images that are purely decorative so that the screen reader doesn’t attempt to read them.
