<h1>Interesting Things</h1>
<h3>Mar 2020</h3>
<p>Some things that I find interesting. Really just notes at this point.</p>
<h3>ðŸ§® <a href="dt-periodicity.md">Discrete Time Periodicity</a></h3>
<p>A small write up about the weirdness of periodicity when we leave
continuous time.</p>
<h3>ðŸ“¹ Face Recognition</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Boston Marathon is a good example of law enforcement
successfully using public cameras to catch some bad guys.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using facial recognition is the cheap, cop-out way to fight
crime. Other ways include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>More patrols</li>
<li>Poverty reduction</li>
<li>Homelessness reduction</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>One way yo use facial recognition that might reduce its harms is to
require that it can't be run in real-time. Police can collect video
footage and then ask a judge for a warrant to use facial recognition
on a section of that video. Sure, warrants haven't always been
terribly effective at protecting people's privacy (NSA), but this
might be a way to at least get some handle on it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From a talk I went to this month: &quot;It would be nice to think we
could regulate our way out of this, but all the evidence is that we
can't.&quot; Regulators aren't domain experts, and tech is moving too
fast.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Illinois bio-metric law good.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GDPR good.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Police use of force, misuse of personal image:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have the laws, we're just not being aggressive enough in
enforcing them.</li>
<li>Little reason to think that facial recognition will be any
different if we can't convince attorney generals and etc to
litigate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>ðŸŒ³ Environment</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards might incentivise
increases in vehicle sizes. This is because, in part, vehicle
emission standards are set by how large the vehicles footprint is. I
agree that emission standards should take into account how large a
car is, but I worry that the balance isn't quite right.</p>
<p>Cars seem to be getting bigger. Bigger cars pollute more. Bad.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>An interesting article about some problems with anti-food-waste
campaigns. Given time, it would be nice to read more into this. Food
waste is definitely bad, but this raises interesting questions about
our response.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>One of the best articles I've read all year. While it isn't directly
related to the environment, I think this article is very relevant for
when we think about how to write sensible policy.</p>
