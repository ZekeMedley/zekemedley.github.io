<h1>No Duck Typing In Rust</h1>
<h3>July 2020</h3>
<h2>Duck Typing</h2>
<p>From Wikipedia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing">duck typing</a> is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>an application of the duck test— &quot;If it walks like a duck and it
quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck&quot;— to determine if an
object can be used for a particular purpose. With normal typing,
suitability is determined by an object's type. In duck typing, an
object's suitability is determined by the presence of certain
methods and properties, rather than the type of the object itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Languages like Python use duck typing. A function like that adds two
objects will work on anything that can do addition. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">&gt;&gt;&gt; def add(a, b):
...     return a + b
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; add(1, 1)
2
&gt;&gt;&gt; add(&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;)
&#x27;foobar&#x27;
</code></pre>
<p>This shouldn't come as a terrible surprise to anyone who has written
much Python before. Other languages also employ duck typing. C++
templates, for example, also use it. What's interesting though is that
Rust does not.</p>
<p>In order to show an example of this, lets take a look at a function
called <code>element_wise_weighted_sum</code>. This function takes two containers
and their weights as arguments. Then, it returns a new container that
is the result of multiplying each container by its weight and adding
them together. In linear algebra terms, this might look something like
this, assuming that <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are scalars and <code>C</code> and <code>D</code> are
vectors:</p>
<pre><code>a*C + b*D
</code></pre>
<h2>C++ &amp; Rust</h2>
<p>Lets take a stab at writing this function in C++ and Rust. Along the
way we'll see how Rust's decision to not allow duck typing changes how
the function is written. Here's the C++ version:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">template&lt;class T, class Container&gt;
std::vector&lt;T&gt; element_wise_weighted_sum(Container&amp; lhs, Container&amp; rhs, T lhw, T rhw) {
  std::vector&lt;T&gt; result(lhs.size());
  for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; lhs.size(); ++i) {
    result[i] = lhs[i] * lhw + rhs[i] * rhw;
  }
  return result;
}
</code></pre>
<p>It's pretty straightforward. Our function is generic over two types, a
container and an element type. The weighted sum is just a small for
loop.</p>
<p>Notice that there are couple things we don't have to tell the type
system. We don't have to tell it that Container will always hold type
<code>T</code>, we don't have to tell it <code>T</code> will implement <code>+</code> and <code>*</code>, we don't
have to tell it that <code>Container</code> will be iteratable, we don't have to
tell it <code>Container</code> will have a <code>size()</code> method, we don't have to tell
it that <code>T</code> is copyable, and we don't have to tell it that
<code>Container</code> will be indexable. C++ just figures that out. If we try to
use types that don't satisfy those implicit constraints, our compiler
will give us an error telling us that.</p>
<p>Rust though is a slightly different story. Here's an equivalent Rust
function.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">fn element_wise_weighted_sum&lt;T&gt;(
    lhs: &amp;[T],
    rhs: &amp;[T],
    lhw: T,
    rhw: T,
) -&gt; Result&lt;Vec&lt;T&gt;, &amp;&#x27;static str&gt;
where
    T: std::ops::Add&lt;Output = T&gt; + std::ops::Mul&lt;Output = T&gt; + Copy,
{
    if lhs.len() != rhs.len() {
        return Err(&quot;can&#x27;t multiply arrays of differnt lengths&quot;);
    }
    Ok(lhs
        .iter()
        .zip(rhs)
        .map(|(&amp;lhs, &amp;rhs)| lhs * lhw + rhs * rhw)
        .collect())
}
</code></pre>
<p>Rust is a different story. In this function we've had to be explicit
about all the things that were implied in C++.</p>
<ul>
<li>Container holds type <code>T</code> → <code>lhs: &amp;[T]</code></li>
<li><code>T</code> will implement <code>+</code> and <code>-</code> → <code>T: std::ops::Add&lt;Output = T&gt; + std::ops::Mul&lt;Output = T&gt;</code></li>
<li>Container will be iterable → container is a slice.</li>
<li><code>T</code> is copyable - <code>T: Copy</code></li>
</ul>
<h2>My Take</h2>
<p>Rust is forcing us to be explicit about the assumptions we're making
about our code. In this case, I'd say that's a good thing. I'll give
an example though of that being painful from my work on
<a href="https://servo.org/">Servo</a>.</p>
<p>In CSS there are specified values and there are computed
ones. Specified values are ones that you write in your
style sheets. For example, <code>color: black</code>. Computed values are ones
that the browser uses when it actually paints the website. For example,
<code>color: black</code> becomes <code>color: rgb(0, 0, 0)</code>. You can see computed
values in your web inspector. Here they are in Firefox:</p>
<p><img class="med-img" src="media/computed_values.jpg" alt="CSS computed values in Firefox" /></p>
<p>In Firefox, every CSS value has a computed and a specified type so
when possible we try and make our operations on them as generic as
possible. This can get cumbersome though if you need to do a group of
reasonably complex operations on those types.</p>
<p>My specific example is working with a generic percentage type. Say we
want to do the following things with it:</p>
<ul>
<li>add assign → <code>+=</code></li>
<li>add → <code>+</code></li>
<li>subtract assign → <code>-=</code></li>
<li>subtract → <code>-</code></li>
<li>... (multiply, divide)</li>
</ul>
<p>To get that to work in Rust, you need an insanely long where clause.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">where
	Percentage: Add&lt;Output = Percentage&gt; + AddAssign // + ...
</code></pre>
<p>In C++ it would <em>just work</em>.</p>
