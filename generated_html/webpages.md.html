<h1>Webpages</h1>
<p>While I've got some free time here between school ending and starting
work on Firefox I thought it might be fun to try to make a website a
day. This is inspired by things like inktober where people try and do
a drawing a day with the difference that I doubt that I'll do this for
an entire month.</p>
<h3>🐁 <a href="static/aesop.html">Aesop's Fable</a></h3>
<p>A new font (Karla) that I have not used before, and boxes that move
with your mouse. The movement is most visible when you have a mouse
but on mobile touching the screen will causes them to wiggle.</p>
<h3>🕋 <a href="static/three.html">3D Cube</a></h3>
<p>A spinning 3D cube made with Three.js. I made some effort to have
crisp edges, nice shine, and good colors.</p>
<h3>👀 <a href="static/reader.html">Screen Reader Preferred</a></h3>
<p>A website best read with a screen reader about writing websites that
are screen reader compatible.</p>
<h3>🌊 <a href="static/text-background-image.html">Masking Text &amp; CSS Animation</a></h3>
<p>Masks text over an image of the ocean and has some animated bubbles. I
like websites with a video banner on their homepage, but feel like it
is often more for show than functionality. I was interested in
exploring how something like that could be incorporated into other
parts of a website.</p>
<h3>🎨 <a href="static/keyah/keyah.html">Personal Store Page</a></h3>
<p>Mockup of a store page for a friend of mine named Keyah who'd like to
sell some of her art. I also made a mockup of a new Cascade Organic
website in a similar style <a href="static/cascade/index.html">here</a>. More to come on
that front.</p>
