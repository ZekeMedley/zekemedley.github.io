This is my personal website. As much as possible, it is generated from
markdown files. This is because I am too lazy to write things in HTML
my self. Much of the styling of this website is based on the MNT
Reaserch website which I think is really nice. You can find it here:

Next goals:

* The markdown generator needs to support customizing the sidebar.
* Other customization features:
  - background color
  - font
  - logo (sidebar)
  - Website name & image in tab bar.
