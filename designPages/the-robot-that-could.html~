        <h1>The Robot That Could</h1>
        <h3>&mdash; One weekend, <b>one mission.</b></h3>

        <p>
            The robot that could was conceptualized two days before its final
            presentation, built the day before, and perfected the day of.
            Despite this, it completed the final course for Berkeley's DESINV 22
            class admirably. Its durrable construction meant that desipte being
            run over and pushed off a ramp by larger robots, it was able to
            complete the course quickly and while remaining intact.

	    This project would not have been possible without the
	    incredible design work for my partner Sarah Katz.

	  Process.
	</h2>
	<p>
	  We began designing Purple Rain with a MDF wood chassis
	  prototype on the laser cutter, and a simple motor control
	  system to prototype our gearing. The DC motors powering the
	  robot donâ€™t have much torque, so we took steps in our design
	  to gear down the motors, and to make the chassis as
	  lightweight as possible. To reduce weight in the chassis, we
	  used the same honeycomb structure previously used in our
	  quad-copter chassis design, and made the robot triangular,
	  rather than square. The initial prototype also featured a
	  cloth hinge to allow for access to its internals.
