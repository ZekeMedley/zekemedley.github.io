        <h1>Generatively Designed Drone Chassis</h1>
        <h3>&mdash; Better, faster <b>stronger.</b></h3>

        <p>
            3D printing a drone chassis poses a variety of challenges. A drone
            chassis needs to be reasonably durable, break well, and
            simultaneously be extremely lightweight. Meeting these requirements
            well on a traditional 3D printer is rather difficult as PLA isn’t
            particularly strong and 3D prints are weak where their layers join.
            In the beginning of my drone design process I attempted to get
            around these constraints with my own designs, but these weren't
            cutting it for me. Enter generative design.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the moment, Autodesk Fusion 360’s generative design tools are
            free to use for students. Generative design often produces complex
            geometries which are difficult to produce. For 3D printers,
            particularly Stereolithography ones, these geometries are easy. As a
            side project at the end of my Freshman year of college I worked on
            creating a better drone chassis for my DIY drone.
