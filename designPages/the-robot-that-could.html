        <h1>The Robot That Could</h1>
        <h3>&mdash; One weekend, <b>one mission.</b></h3>

        <p>
            The robot that could was conceptualized two days before its final
            presentation, built the day before, and perfected the day of.
            Despite this, it completed the final course for Berkeley's DESINV 22
            class admirably. Its durrable construction meant that desipte being
            run over and pushed off a ramp by larger robots, it was able to
            complete the course quickly and while remaining intact.

	    This project would not have been possible without the
	    incredible design work for my partner Sarah Katz.
