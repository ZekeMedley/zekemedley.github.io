Tasked with making a drawing machine, I wanted to use an
unconventional medium and learn more about molding. I 3D printed a
model of a monkey skull, set a silicone mold around it, and poured
melted crayons into it. The skull sits on a vibrating table made with
a Arduino controlled subwoofer and moves around as it vibrates
creating interesting patterns related to its shape.
