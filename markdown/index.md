Hi. Welcome to my website. I'm Zeke. I'm studying Electrical
Engineering and Computer Sciences at UC Berkeley with a particular
interest in programming languages and secure, fast code.

I've collected some of my work here.

Also, all of this work is made from ideas that I took from
[Annalise Kamegawa](https://www.github.io/akamegawa98).
