# Panotech
### Feb 2020

Panotech is a critique of public surveillance and art
installation. Panotech tries to give a body to a surveillance system
that is normally far too discrete. It was created for Berkeley's
Critical Practices class as a final project by Alyssa, Cameron,
Serena, and myself.

Panotech got first place in its section at Jacobs Hall's end of
semester design showcase and subsequently received an
[Ignite Grant](https://jacobsinstitute.berkeley.edu/news/the-spring-2020-innovation-catalysts-grant-recipients/)
to pay for the projects continuation.

As of this writing, we are continuing to develop Panotech and you can
