# Interesting Things
### Mar 2020

Some things that I find interesting. Really just notes at this point.

### ðŸ§® [Discrete Time Periodicity](dt-periodicity.md)

A small write up about the weirdness of periodicity when we leave
continuous time.

### ðŸ“¹ Face Recognition

* The Boston Marathon is a good example of law enforcement
  successfully using public cameras to catch some bad guys.

* Using facial recognition is the cheap, cop-out way to fight
  crime. Other ways include, but are not limited to:
  - More patrols
  - Poverty reduction
  - Homelessness reduction
  - ...
  
* One way yo use facial recognition that might reduce its harms is to
  require that it can't be run in real-time. Police can collect video
  footage and then ask a judge for a warrant to use facial recognition
  on a section of that video. Sure, warrants haven't always been
  terribly effective at protecting people's privacy (NSA), but this
  might be a way to at least get some handle on it.
  
* From a talk I went to this month: "It would be nice to think we
  could regulate our way out of this, but all the evidence is that we
  can't." Regulators aren't domain experts, and tech is moving too
  fast.
  
* Illinois bio-metric law good.
* GDPR good.

* Police use of force, misuse of personal image:
  - We have the laws, we're just not being aggressive enough in
    enforcing them.
  - Little reason to think that facial recognition will be any
    different if we can't convince attorney generals and etc to
    litigate.


### ðŸŒ³ Environment

* Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards might incentivise
  increases in vehicle sizes. This is because, in part, vehicle
  emission standards are set by how large the vehicles footprint is. I
  agree that emission standards should take into account how large a
  car is, but I worry that the balance isn't quite right.
  
  Cars seem to be getting bigger. Bigger cars pollute more. Bad.

* An interesting article about some problems with anti-food-waste
  campaigns. Given time, it would be nice to read more into this. Food
  waste is definitely bad, but this raises interesting questions about
  our response.

* One of the best articles I've read all year. While it isn't directly
  related to the environment, I think this article is very relevant for
  when we think about how to write sensible policy.
