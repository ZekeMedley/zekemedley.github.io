# Websites

While I've got some free time here between school ending and starting
work on Firefox I thought it might be fun to try to make a website a
day. This is inspired by things like inktober where people try and do
a drawing a day with the difference that I doubt that I'll do this for
an entire month.

### 🐁 [Aesop's Fable](static/aesop.html)
A new font (Karla) that I have not used before, and boxes that move
with your mouse. The movement is most visible when you have a mouse
but on mobile touching the screen will causes them to wiggle.
### 🕋 [3D Cube](static/three.html)
A spinning 3D cube made with Three.js. I made some effort to have
crisp edges, nice shine, and good colors.
### 👀 [Screen Reader Preferred](static/reader.html)
A website best read with a screen reader about writing websites that
are screen reader compatible.
